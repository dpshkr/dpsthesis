  <h1> Acknowledgments</h1>
  
  <p>First, I wish to express my gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Kausik Majumdar, for his constant support and guidance throughout the course of this work. I am also greatly thankful for all the help and insightful discussions provided by other members of Quantum Electronics Lab. I also wish to acknowledge the faculty who have
taught me many interesting and motivating courses at IISc and elsewhere. I am also very thankful to all the Department of Electrical Communications Engineering staff for their help and cooperation.
My gratitude also goes to CeNSE and Materials Engineering department members for their collaboration in material synthesis, device fabrication, and characterization.
I would like to thank all the developers of many open-source software projects used for data acquisition, analysis and presentation.
I also thank all the researchers and scientists across the globe whose work this thesis tries to improve further. Finally, I thank my family members for their support.</p>
