<h1> Abstract </h1>
<p>As the state of the art in computation, communication and sensing
advances, there is an ever-increasing search for novel materials and
device architectures to satisfy the growing demands for more
functionality, performance, smaller device sizes, speed and energy
efficiency. Lower-dimensional materials - one-dimensional and
two-dimensional materials and novel devices using them have been at the
forefront of this search in recent years. The availability of many of
these materials with various electronic and optical properties and the
possibility to easily form their heterostructures has put them in this
position. This work will present some electronic and optical devices
using low-dimensional materials, addressing problems in high-performance
and energy-efficient transistors and infrared optical detection.</p>
<p><strong>Tellurium-based gate-all-around nanowire junctionless
transistor</strong>: Tellurium is an element with a unique helical
van-der Waal atomic structure, making it possible to make nanowires
(one-dimensional) and sheets with atomic thickness (two-dimensional)
without introducing surface defects and degrading mobility. Here, we
explore gate-all-around junctionless transistor architecture, a suitable
structure for sub-5nm technology node due to its excellent
electrostatics, using the Tellurium nanowires. Further, we use h-BN, a
two-dimensional insulator, as the gate dielectric. The combination of
the unique material properties and the device architecture helped us
fabricate p-type transistors with field-effect mobility of 570 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{cm^2/V\cdot s}\)</span>, a high drive
current of 216 mA/mm and an on-off ratio of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{2\times 10^4}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Electrically self-aligned SnSe<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub>
heterojunction MOSFET/TFET</strong>: Tunnel FETs have been important
devices in the search for energy-efficient transistors as they can have
subthreshold-swing less than 60 mV/dec. Also, achieving self-aligned
structures has been the one key factor behind the successful development
of Silicon-based MOS technology. Achieving such a self-alignment using
fabrication processes has been difficult for two-dimensional materials
due to the lack of doping techniques. Using partially overlapping gates,
we present an electrically defined self-aligned <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SnSe_2}\)</span>/<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{WSe_2}\)</span> heterostructure device.
The device operates as n-type and p-type transistors by applying
appropriate gate biases. The device can also be used as a test platform
to discern the properties of the heterojunction without confounding the
effects of contact resistance. This device can be operated as a tunnel
transistor as well. At room temperature, the device exhibits a
subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/dec.</p>
<p><strong>High current double-channel 2D transistor for lower contact
resistance</strong>: Transistors with high current drive are important
for high performance as they offer high speed and larger fanout.
However, getting a high current drive has been challenging in 2D
transistors due to limitations arising from higher contact resistance.
Also, getting higher current drives without increasing the device
footprint on the chip is a major challenge. To this end, we present a
vertically integrated double-channel transistor based on ultrathin 2D
material to meet these challenges. The device structure effectively
increases the contact area, thus reducing the contact resistance by
about a factor of two without compromising the device footprint or
electrostatic integrity. The proposed device structure achieves a high
drive current of over 400 mA/mm.</p>
<p><strong>Intraband hot-electron-based IR detection using 2D material
heterostructure</strong>: Infrared radiation, being low energy, requires
lower bandgap materials for the conventional photodetection mechanism of
electron transition from the valence to the conduction band. However,
most low band-gap materials, like black phosphorous, are known to be
unstable and not friendly with standard fabrication processes. Here, we
present infra-red detection using stable wide-bandgap material
heterostructure and electron transition from one material’s conduction
band to the other’s conduction band. We propose multiple device
architectures to understand the mechanism of the device operation from
their bias-dependent photo response and simple physical models. The
device exhibits the responsivity of  40 mA/W when excited with 1550 nm
wavelength IR radiation. The device operates and exhibits a nearly flat
response up to 1800 nm, and a signal above the noise floor could be
observed up to 30 kHz.</p>
