Channel FET for High Current and Low Contact Resistance Transistors</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scaling transistors to tiny dimensions has been one of the key
reasons behind the onset of the information era. The spread of
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on massive data
sets has created extreme computing requirements. Such high-performance
computing would require transistors that give large current drives with
low footprints so that larger systems can be integrated into smaller
areas. MBCFETs (Multi-channel bridge FETs) have been promising
transistor designs that offer a planar solution to device scaling<span
class="citation" data-cites="lee2004three"><sup>1</sup></span>. Since 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can be scaled down to a
monolayer limit along the vertical dimensions, they are the ideal
semiconducting channel materials for MBCFETs. Multibridge channel FET
(MBCFET) have been demonstrated in multiple technologies, including
Silicon<span class="citation"
data-cites="BarraudVLSITech BaeIEDM"><sup>2,3</sup></span> and 2D
materials<span class="citation"
data-cites="hiteshMBCFET huang2021ultrathin xia2022wafer XiongIEDM"><sup>4–7</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Contact resistance has been one of the key issues in the failure to
achieve high-performance 2D transistors<span class="citation"
data-cites="das2021transistors somvanshi2017nature"><sup>8,9</sup></span>.
Many solutions have been proposed to mitigate this problem<span
class="citation"
data-cites="shen2021ultralow kwon2022interaction english2016improved chou2021antimony jin2022contact"><sup>10–14</sup></span>.
The most successful solutions to date have been to use novel contact
materials, especially semimetals like Bismuth<span class="citation"
data-cites="shen2021ultralow jin2022contact"><sup>10,14</sup></span> or
Antimony<span class="citation"
data-cites="chou2021antimony"><sup>13</sup></span>. In<span
class="citation" data-cites="kwon2022interaction"><sup>11</sup></span>,
a selenium buffer layer has been used to decrease metal-semiconductor
interactions and improve contact resistance. In<span class="citation"
data-cites="english2016improved"><sup>12</sup></span>, . All these
methods utilize special contact material or deposition techniques to
improve contact resistance. These methods might be, therefore, difficult
to integrate into standard process flows.</p>
<p>This chapter proposes a slightly modified 2-channel MBCFET using 2D
semiconductors as channel material. We also use graphite, another 2D
material, as the contact material. This structure leads to a reduction
in the effective contact resistance of the transistor and can be
extended to any contact metal if need be. We demonstrate an on-current
of 0.43 mA/<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\mu m}\)</span> at a
channel length of 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\mu
m}\)</span> and an on-off ratio of more than <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{10^8}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="device-structure-and-fabrication">Device structure and
fabrication</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="#device-struct-frab" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a>(f) schematically shows the
device structure. Two monolayer channels are stacked on each other,
separated by the few-layer graphene contacts acting as source and drain.
Two gates are also provided to control both channels. The device is
completely symmetric with respect to each channel. Both gates are
essential for effective electrostatic control of the channels. These
gates have been labelled TG (Top Gate) and BG (Bottom Gate) in Figure <a
href="#device-struct-frab" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a>(f). However, owing to the
symmetric structure of the device, both gates are equivalent.</p>
<p>The device fabrication is shown schematically in Figure <a
href="#device-struct-frab" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a>(d-f). The corresponding
optical micrographs are shown in Figure <a href="#device-struct-frab"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a>(a-c). Ti/Au (20 nm/40 nm)
contacts are initially patterned on a Silicon substrate with 280 nm
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SiO_2}\)</span> deposited using
optical lithography and DC sputtering. A 10 - 15 nm thick h-BN is then
dry transferred on the gate contact.<span class="citation"
data-cites="castellanos2014deterministic"><sup>15</sup></span>.</p>
<figure id="device-struct-frab">

</figure>
<p>This is followed by dry transfer of a monolayer <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MoS_2}\)</span> and the two graphite
layers (10 - 15 nm), which act as source and drain. As described in the
previous section, Graphite can provide ultra-thin contacts (down to
monolayer) while maintaining good stability, which is crucial for device
scaling. <a href="#device-struct-frab" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a> (a) and (d) show the device
in this state. The channel length is kept as small as possible, about
1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\mu}\)</span>m. The device is
annealed at this stage in a high vacuum at <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{200^oC}\)</span> for three hours. Next
(shown in Figure <a href="#device-struct-frab" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="device-struct-frab">1.1</a>(b) and (e)), another
monolayer is transferred on top of this stack, closely aligning with the
previous monolayer. Finally, the top h-BN and the top gate are
transferred (acting as the top-gate stack) to complete the device. The
device is again annealed in a high vacuum at for three hours. The final
device is shown in Figures <a href="#device-struct-frab"

</figure>
<p>Its scalability is the major advantage of a 2D material-based over a
3D material-based (like Silicon) transistor. Hence, it is important to
analyze the short-channel performance of the proposed device structure
to be sure that we are not sacrificing the key advantage of the 2D
material used for the channel. To analyze the scalability of our
proposed design, we simulate three device structures shown in Figure <a
href="#sim-structure" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sim-structure">1.2</a>. Figure <a href="#sim-structure"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sim-structure">1.2</a>(a)
shows the cross-section of a single gate device with a monolayer
semiconductor as the semiconducting channel. This structure has only a
bottom gate. The simulation details are given in Appendix <a
href="#transistor-sim" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="transistor-sim">[transistor-sim]</a>. Although the top
side of the channel is covered with an insulator, the whole interface is
assumed to be electrostatically open. Figure <a href="#sim-structure"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sim-structure">1.2</a>b shows
the cross-section of a double-gated device with a single monolayer
semiconducting channel. In this structure, the top interface is tied to
the gate potential. Figure <a href="#sim-structure"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sim-structure">1.2</a>c shows
the proposed device structure. This structure has two monolayer
semiconducting channels. Both top and bottom interfaces are gated. The
simulation was performed by solving the 2D Poisson equation
self-consistently with the drift-diffusion equation.<span
class="citation" data-cites="CaoCompactModel"><sup>16</sup></span>. We
do not consider any source/drain underlap region in all three
structures, as underlap regions may contribute to series resistances and
increase the device footprint. Each of the structures is characterized
by three parameters - <span class="math inline">\(t_{ins}\)</span>, the
thickness of the insulator, <span class="math inline">\(t_{sd}\)</span>,
the thickness of source and drain contacts and <span
class="math inline">\(L_{ch}\)</span>, the channel length.</p>
<p>These parameters are schematically shown for each structure in Figure
<a href="#sim-structure" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sim-structure">1.2</a>. The source/drain thickness <span
class="math inline">\(t_{sd}\)</span> is an essential parameter for 2D
transistors, as the short channel effects are influenced by the fringing
fields arising from the source/drain contacts<span class="citation"
data-cites="suryavanshi2021scaling"><sup>17</sup></span>. We select
small <span class="math inline">\(t_{sd}=2\)</span> nm to keep the short
channel effects from such fringing fields at a minimum. The requirement
for such a small thickness of the source/drain contacts can be fulfilled
by using 2D conductors like graphite. The insulator thickness <span
class="math inline">\(t_{ins}\)</span> is taken to be 2 nm. The relative
dielectric permittivity of the insulator is assumed to be <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa = 5\)</span>. As it has been previously
shown<span class="citation"
data-cites="TaurShortChannel suryavanshi2021scaling"><sup>17,18</sup></span>,
in the case of monolayer 2D semiconducting channels, <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> does not play a very significant
role in device scaling, and only <span
class="math inline">\(t_{ins}\)</span> does.</p>
<figure id="subthreshold-swing">
<img src="/Figures/03_03.png" />
<figcaption>Cross-section of the simulated device structures (a) Single
channel device with a single gate, (b) Single channel device with double
gates, and (c) dual-channel device with double gates. Gate (G), Drain
(D) and Source (S) terminals are also shown. The dashed lines mark the
simulation region. <span id="subthreshold-swing"
label="subthreshold-swing"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The subthreshold swing as a function of the channel length <span
class="math inline">\(L_{ch}\)</span> is shown in Figure <a
href="#subthreshold-swing" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subthreshold-swing">1.3</a>. <span
class="math inline">\(L_{ch}\)</span> varies from 10 nm to 20 nm. As
expected, the single gate device shows a higher subthreshold swing
(shown in blue dots) due to poor gate electrostatic control. However,
the subthreshold swing of the double gated single channel device (shown
in green stars) and the double-channel device (shown in red crosses) is
nearly the same. The double-gated device exhibits slightly better
subthreshold swing compared to the dual-channel device. Although in the
dual-channel device, there is only one gate per channel, compared to two
gates per channel in a double-gate device, the stacking of the two
monolayer channels on top of each other improves the electrostatics of
the device. However, in the case of the single-gated device structure,
the top side of the channel is electrostatically open, degrading the
device’s performance.</p>
<h2 id="contact-resistance-and-gate-capacitance">Contact resistance and
gate capacitance</h2>
<p>Gate capacitance is also an important factor along with the
on-current for overall circuit speed. A higher gate capacitance would,
in general, mean a slower speed. The gate capacitance of a single
channel device in the on condition with a single gate is given by <span
class="math inline">\(C_{0} = WL\epsilon_{ins}/t_{ins}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the channel length and <span
class="math inline">\(t_{ins}\)</span> is the thickness of the gate
dielectric with a dielectric constant <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ins}\)</span>. As shown in Figure <a
href="#capacitance-resistance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="capacitance-resistance">1.4</a>(b), the proposed device
structure is equivalent to two single-channel devices and a gate
capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{DC}=2C_0\)</span>. Similarly,
a double-gate transistor also has a gate capacitance <span
class="math inline">\(C_{DG}=2C_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The current injection mechanisms of single-channel and double-channel
devices are shown in Figure <a href="#capacitance-resistance"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="capacitance-resistance">1.4</a>(a), top and bottom
panels, respectively. Since we use a very low resistance contact like
graphite, the current injection is not limited by the contact itself but
by the <em>interface</em> between the contact and the semiconductor.
Therefore, providing two channels to the contact will improve the
contact resistance by approximately a factor of two.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with single gate device</strong>: Regarding
on-current and gate capacitance, our proposed device structure is
equivalent to a single gate device with twice the channel width <span
class="math inline">\(2W\)</span>. However, as the previous section
shows, a single-gate device performs poorly at shorter channel lengths.
Therefore, placing the channel vertically, as in our proposed structure,
improves the drain current and the electrostatic integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with double gate device</strong>: A double-gate
device should ideally give the same drain current for a similar gate
overdrive voltage since the current in a transistor is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_D = \frac{\mu
C_{ins}W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_T)^2\]</span></p>
<p>However, this is not the case practically since the current situation
is limited by contact resistance. This is shown in Figure <a
href="#capacitance-resistance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="capacitance-resistance">1.4</a>(c). The figure shows the
transfer characteristics of a single-channel device with a single gate
and double gates. As can be seen, although the drain current improves
slightly, it does not double as expected. This is because the current is
limited by contact resistance. However, as shown in Figure <a
href="#capacitance-resistance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="capacitance-resistance">1.4</a>(d), the current nearly
doubles for the proposed double-channel device, with the same gate
capacitance as that of the double-gate structure compared to a
single-channel single-gated device.</p>
<p>Therefore, the proposed double channel effectively reduces the
contact resistance without increasing the device footprint and gate
capacitance, maintaining good electrostatic integrity.</p>

<h2 id="device-characteristics">Device characteristics</h2>
<p>Next, the device’s characteristics are shown with two semiconducting
channels in Figures <a href="#dual-channel-chars"

data-reference="dual-channel-chars">1.5</a>(a-b). Figure <a
href="#dual-channel-chars" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="dual-channel-chars">1.5</a>(a) shows the output
characteristics of the device. As can be seen, the device offers an
on-current of about 430 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\mu
A}\)</span>/<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\mu A}\)</span> at a
drain bias of 10 V and a gate bias of 12 V. Due to a larger channel
length, a higher drain bias is applied to provide a sufficient electric
field. Channel length scaling to lower dimensions may ease this
requirement. We also note that the device current is somewhat restricted
by the contact resistance of the Graphite-<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MoS_2}\)</span> interface. This phenomenon
can be observed at the high gate and drain bias, where the
characteristics start crowding together and no longer increase with
linear or square dependence, as the conventional MOSFET theory suggests.
The transfer characteristics of the device are shown . The device offers
an on-off ratio of more than <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{10^8}\)</span>. The subthreshold slope of
the device at a drain bias of 1 V is about 120 mV/dec. Characterization
of another device is given in Appendix <a

<p>In conclusion, we have analyzed and demonstrated a double channel
device design that exhibits an on-current of about 430 <span

simple, and the device design is scalable to lower channel lengths,
