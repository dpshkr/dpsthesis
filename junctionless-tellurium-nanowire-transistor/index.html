In parallel, several high-mobility, non-silicon channel options are

<p>Three technological roadblocks must be overcome to achieve these
high-performance, ultra-scaled devices. First, the source-drain
electrical isolation in a transistor is usually achieved by doping. The
required spatial steepness of the doping profile is non-trivial to
achieve in such ultra-short channel nanowire FETs. It also adds to the
large variability, resulting in low yield. In this direction,
junctionless FET has attracted a lot of attention for high
scalability<span class="citation"
data-cites="lee2009junctionless gundapaneni2011enhanced"><sup>11,12</sup></span>
where one uses a narrow conducting channel, and the gate voltage is used
to deplete the carriers from the channel to turn it off, thus avoiding
source-drain junction formation through ion implantation. Second, since
the nanowire must be very narrow to achieve the required gate control,
the surface roughness scattering is enhanced<span class="citation"
data-cites="jin2007modeling ramayya2008electron"><sup>13,14</sup></span>,
significantly degrading the carrier mobility. A nanowire channel with a
dangling-bond-free surface will be ideally suited to reduce such
mobility degradation. Third, as the device footprint goes down with
transistor scaling, the effective contact area at the source and drain
reduces. This increases the fraction of the contact resistance in the
total transistor resistance under on condition, which is detrimental to
the overall drive current, switching speed, current saturation, and
output resistance<span class="citation"
data-cites="majumdar2010effects"><sup>15</sup></span>. One must use
novel techniques to reduce contact resistivity.</p>
<p>In an attempt to address the above-mentioned issues, this chapter
presents a dual-gated tellurium (Te) nanowire junctionless transistor.
The unique chiral nature of the nanowire crystal structure<span
class="citation"
data-cites="liang2009synthesis qin2020raman"><sup>16,17</sup></span>
allows a high hole mobility due to a dangling-bond-free surface, and its
low electron affinity helps us to achieve zero Schottky barrier at the
contact interface, reducing the contact resistance. We achieve a drive
current of <span class="math inline">\(216\,\mathrm{\mu A/\mu

<p>Te is an element in the chalcogen group, and its crystal structure
consists of covalently bonded one-dimensional chains of Te along the
c-axis that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions [inset
of Figure <a href="#fig:material_char_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:material_char_01">1.1</a>(a)]. Thus, the nanowire
form of Te is predominantly bound by lower energy surfaces that are
produced by only breaking the weak van der Waals bonds and not the
strong covalent bonds, leading to the dangling-bond-free surface of the
nanowire. This unique anisotropic crystal structure of Te provides an
opportunity to synthesize nanowires of Te down to single chain Te
atoms<span class="citation"

<p>The step-by-step fabrication process of the junctionless FET is
illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:plasma_clean_01"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:plasma_clean_01">1.3</a>.
We drop cast the Te nanowires onto a degenerately doped Si substrate
coated with 285 nm thick, thermally grown, high quality <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SiO_{2}}\)</span>. A low-power Ar
treatment is then performed to remove any residual PVP coating from the
nanowires. A thin layer of high-quality hBN (<span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 15 nm) is immediately transferred
onto the nanowire using a dry transfer technique<span class="citation"
data-cites="Castellanos_Gomez_2014"><sup>30</sup></span> to define the
top gate dielectric. <span>The atomically smooth surface of the
dangling-bond-free hBN gate dielectric provides an ideal interface with
the dangling-bond-free Te nanowire channel.</span></p>
<p>Subsequently, electron beam lithography is performed to define the
source, the drain, and the gate metallization areas. To remove any
unintentional residue and surface oxidation<span class="citation"
data-cites="lan2007dispersibility"><sup>31</sup></span> from the
source/drain region of the nanowire, a second plasma cleaning step is
performed, which improves the contact interface quality. Ni/Au is then
deposited using DC magnetron sputtering, followed by lift-off in acetone
to complete the device fabrication. More details of the fabrication are
provided in Appendix <a href="#a01_00" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="a01_00">[a01_00]</a>.</p>
<p>We find that an optimum plasma cleaning is a crucial step in the
fabrication, which helps remove residual PVP capping layer and possible
interfacial oxide, improving the interface quality and reducing the
contact resistance. A careful optimization shows that Ar plasma cleaning
for 20 s at a power level of and a pressure of 10 mbar results in the
optimum device performance. The Figs. <a href="#fig:plasma_clean_02"

of two different nanowires, one without the plasma cleaning and the

bandgap</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="haeffler1996electron"><sup>33</sup></span>, exhibit strong
p-type conductivity, even without any gating. This allows us to operate
the fabricated transistor as a dual-gated junctionless nanowire FET, as

on state and requires a positive gate voltage to deplete the holes from
the channel (depletion mode). The top gate using the hBN dielectric
controls the channel conductivity, while the global back gate can
control both the channel portion, as well as the underlap regions and
the metal contact region. This allows us to avoid the need for
source/drain doping, and the device works as a junctionless

device from 5 to 270 K are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:low_temp_01"

It is striking that under on condition (<span

class="math inline">\(I_D\)</span> is a very weak function of
temperature, even down to temperatures as low as 5 K, and <span

temperature (due to a subsequent increase in hole mobility, as discussed
later) - clearly suggesting barrier-free hole injection from the
contact.</p>

the contact interface. This is independent of <span

<p>Previous reports suggest that Te exhibits high mobility for thicker
films (and wider nanowires); however, it becomes challenging to turn the
channel off at such channel thickness. On the other hand, for thin
channels, where the on-off ratio is improved, the carrier mobility
degrades significantly, and Te loses its attractiveness as a
high-mobility channel. Figure <a href="#fig:mob_03"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:mob_03">1.13</a>(a) shows
the on-off ratio achieved in various Te-based transistor structures
reported earlier as a function of the channel thickness (or diameter),
suggesting a strong degradation of the on-off ratio for thicker
channels. From the same figure, we observe that the advantage of the
improved electrostatics <span>due to dual-gated nanowire structure in
the present work is remarkable, allowing us to achieve an on-off ratio
of <span class="math inline">\(2\times10^4\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(@V_{ds}=-1.2\)</span> V) at a relatively larger
nanowire diameter. However, the device’s subthreshold swing is still
relatively large, and there is scope for further optimization on the
gate electrostatics and nanowire-dielectric interface.</span> In Figure
<a href="#fig:mob_03" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mob_03">1.13</a>(b), we compare the performance of
different reports in the on-off ratio and drive current space. We note
from the figure that the present work provides comparable performance
with the best reports in terms of drive current while maintaining a
superior on-off ratio.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, we presented the synthesis, fabrication, and electrical
characterization of high-performance dual-gated p-type Te nanowire
junctionless transistors. The unique combination of contact-barrier-free
hole injection, high hole mobility (<span
class="math inline">\(570\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1390\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/V\cdot s}\)</span> at 270 and
5 K, respectively), <span>dangling-bond-free, clean interface between
the nanowire channel and hBN dielectric,</span> and dual-gated operation
allows us to achieve an on-off ratio in excess of <span
class="math inline">\(2\times10^{4}\)</span> with a high on-current of
<span class="math inline">\(216\,\mu A/\mu m\)</span> even at a
relatively small drain field, which is superior to existing p-type
nanowire FETs. Te nanowires are thus a promising candidate for
next-generation ultra-scaled transistors, as well as for other
nanowire-based electronic applications, including highly scaled memory,
biosensing, fast infrared sensing, and spectroscopy.</p>
