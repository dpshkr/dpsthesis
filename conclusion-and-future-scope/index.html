<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this thesis, we have demonstrated several electronic and
optoelectronic devices using low-dimensional materials - both
two-dimensional and one-dimensional materials. In summary,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>We demonstrated a nanowire-based junctionless transistor.
We use h-BN, a two-dimensional insulator, as the gate dielectric. The
combination of the unique material properties and the device
architecture helped us fabricate p-type transistors with high
field-effect mobility, high on current and excellent on-off ratio.
</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>We designed and demonstrated an electrically defined
self-aligned heterostructure device using partially overlapping gates.
The device can be operated as an n-type and p-type transistor by
applying appropriate gate biases. The device structure can be utilized
as a test platform to discern the properties of the heterojunction
without confounding the effects of contact resistance. This device can
be operated as a tunnel transistor as well. At room temperature, we
successfully demonstrated a sub 60 mV/dec subthreshold swing.
</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>We fabricated a vertically integrated double-channel
transistor based on ultrathin 2D material. The device structure
effectively reduces the contact resistance, has good electrostatic
integrity, and has a low device footprint. We demonstrated a high on
current using this device. </span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Finally, we demonstrated an infra-red detection using
stable wide-bandgap material heterostructure and electron transition
from one material’s conduction band to the other’s conduction band. We
analyzed multiple device architectures to understand the mechanism of
the device operation from their bias-dependent photo response and simple
physical models. The device exhibits good responsivity, broadband
photoresponse, and good speed of operation. </span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-scope">Future Scope</h2>
<p>Based on the devices discussed in this thesis, many possibilities are
open for further improvement. Some are discussed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Further characterization and exploration of Tellurium
nanowire transistors can be performed. The top priority among these
would be to fabricate and characterize short-channel transistors. From a
synthesis and fabrication point of view, techniques to fabricate useful
circuits can be explored. Further, the optical properties of tellurium
nanowires can also be studied.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>The reconfigurable heterojunction can be used to develop
useful. Further improvement of the device, especially in the tunnelling
mode, can be useful for low-power circuits.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>The dual-channel device can be experimentally validated for
short-channel performance. A standard fabrication flow can be developed
to make short-channel devices.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Some more device architectures and wide-band materials can
be tested to improve the IR detector’s performance. Light absorption
needs to be improved by engineering the proper geometry of the device.
Characterization for higher wavelengths and achieving higher speed of
operation can also be explored. Waveguide integration would also help to
improve the light absorption in the detector.</span></p></li>
