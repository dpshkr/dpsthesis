<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="low-dimensional-material">Low-dimensional material</h2>
<p>Low-dimensional materials are materials in which the constituent
atoms/molecules are strongly bonded (usually by covalent bonds) along
some dimensions while weakly (van der Waals bonds) bonded along others.
This leads to two possibilities - two-dimensional and one-dimensional
materials. In two-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 2D
plane, while along the third dimension, the bonding is weak. In
one-dimensional materials, strong bonding is along a 1D line, while the
bonding is weak along the other two dimensions.</p>
<p>The discovery of extremely thin (single layer of carbon atoms) yet
stable 2D layers like graphene<span class="citation"
data-cites="novoselov2005two"><sup>1</sup></span> and ultra-thin
single-wall carbon nanotubes<span class="citation"
data-cites="iijima1993single"><sup>2</sup></span> has led numerous
researchers across the globe to dive into the exciting world of
low-dimensional materials to address problems of technological
importance as well as fundamental understanding of nature.</p>
<h2
id="promise-of-low-dimensional-materials-in-transistor-scaling">Promise
of low-dimensional materials in transistor scaling</h2>
<p>Transistors are fundamental building blocks of all modern
computational systems. Therefore, the efficiency of a transistor, in
terms of energy and speed, will have a major impact on the overall
system’s performance. The number of transistors in a computational
system has grown remarkably since the 1960s, guided by Moore’s law<span
class="citation" data-cites="moore1998cramming"><sup>3</sup></span>. The
transistor dimensions have consistently reduced, making it possible to
pack more transistors into a single chip with the same area<span
class="citation" data-cites="dennard1974design"><sup>4</sup></span>.
Interestingly, this has consistently led computation systems to perform
better for lower costs over the past half-century. In a very short time,
this exponential growth greatly impacted human society’s social,
economic, and cultural aspects. Silicon, a three-dimensional material,
has been the material for transistor channels. However, as the silicon
transistors enter the sub-10nm technology node, the technological
challenges are also ever-increasing. To overcome these challenges, novel
device architectures and materials to make transistors are being
continuously explored by the global research community.</p>
<p>Transistors are switches in which the current between two terminals
(source and drain) is controlled by a third terminal (gate). The
electrostatics of the transistor channel mainly governs the transistor’s
properties.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2\phi (x)}{dx^2} -
\frac{\phi(x)}{\lambda^2} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi (x)\)</span> is the
electrostatic potential along the channel of the device, while <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{t_bt_{ox}\epsilon_b}{\epsilon_{ox}}}\)</span>
is called the characteristic length of the transistor. A smaller
characteristic length allows for a smaller transistor without affecting
the performance. Here <span class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(t_{ox}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ox}\)</span> are the thickness and
dielectric constants of the semiconducting channel and the gate
dielectric, respectively. A significant effort has been put into
improving the gate stack by reducing <span
class="math inline">\(t_{ox}\)</span> and increasing <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ox}\)</span>. At the same time, efforts
to reduce the thickness of the transistor channel, <span
class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span>, have also been significant. However,
the effort to reduce <span class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span> has always
been met with challenges like increased surface roughness, device
variability, and poor interfaces due to dangling bonds. These effects
are most significantly visible in the degradation of field-effect
mobility of the transistors with decreasing <span
class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span> due to an increase in carrier
scattering.</p>
<p>Here is where low-dimensional materials have come to the rescue. Due
to their weak van der Waals bonding along some dimensions, they can be
arbitrarily thinned down along those dimensions without significantly
degrading the channel and interface properties<span class="citation"
data-cites="liu2021promises"><sup>5</sup></span>. A two-dimensional
material can be scaled down to a monolayer without degrading its
properties<span class="citation"
data-cites="novoselov2005two radisavljevic2011single"><sup>1,6</sup></span>.
Similarly, a one-dimensional material can be scaled to a single chain of
atoms/molecules.</p>
<p>However, low-dimensional semiconductors come with a different set of
challenges, which the research community is trying to address. Foremost
among these is the lack of proper contact with the material. Inefficient
metal-semiconductor contacts lead to large contact resistance,
significantly degrading the transistor performance<span class="citation"
data-cites="ngo2020control"><sup>7</sup></span>. Also, the lack of
proper doping techniques and the dependence on intrinsic doping of the
material often leads to significant device-to-device variations. The
lack of doping has also made implementing complementary logic
(<em>n</em>-type and <em>p</em>-type) challenging. Finally, the
wafer-scale fabrication of integrated circuits also remains a
challenge.</p>
<h2
id="low-dimensional-materials-for-optoelectronics-and-photonics">Low-dimensional
materials for optoelectronics and photonics</h2>
<p>Low-dimensional materials have many interesting properties that can
be utilized for various optoelectronic<span class="citation"
data-cites="wang2012electronics an2022perspectives"><sup>8,9</sup></span>
applications like photodetectors<span class="citation"

of a large library of these materials with a wide range of bandgaps has
made them suitable for photodetectors for a wide spectrum of
electromagnetic radiation. The thickness-dependent tunability of the
bandgap has further added to their advantage<span class="citation"
data-cites="nidhi2022impact buscema2014fast"><sup>18,19</sup></span>.
Semimetals like graphene have been used for ultrafast broadband
photoresponse<span class="citation"

materials (partly due to strong quantum confinement) show interesting
properties from quasiparticles like excitons, trions, etc<span
class="citation"
data-cites="chatterjee2023harmonic"><sup>21</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Another major advantage of low-dimensional materials in
optoelectronics arises from the ability to form heterojunctions.
Heterojunctions with a wide variety of properties can be fabricated for
efficient carrier generation and collection in the case of
photodetectors and carrier recombination and light emission in the case
of light-emitting devices. The gain-bandwidth tradeoff has been one of
the major limitations of optoelectronics using low-dimensional
materials<span class="citation"
data-cites="kufer2015highly"><sup>22</sup></span>. This comes from traps
at the semiconductor-substrate interfaces<span class="citation"
data-cites="han2019ambient"><sup>23</sup></span> and the lack of
integration with sensing and detection circuits and systems.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In the previous sections, we have discussed the opportunities and
challenges for low-dimensional material-based devices. In this thesis,
we try to address some of these challenges. The main challenge for
transistor applications is getting high-performance devices at lower
energies. This often involves mitigating contact resistance. For
optoelectronic devices, the challenge has been to get stable devices to
detect even low-energy electromagnetic radiation with high responsivity
and good speed. These challenges have been the main motivational guiding
forces behind this work.</p>
<h2 id="thesis-organizatiom">Thesis Organizatiom</h2>
<p>The rest of the thesis is organized into the following chapters -</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong>: Here, we explore gate-all-around
junctionless transistor architecture, a suitable structure for sub-5nm
technology node due to its excellent electrostatics, using the tellurium
nanowires. Further, we use h-BN, a two-dimensional insulator, as the
gate dielectric. The combination of the unique material properties and
the device architecture helped us fabricate p-type transistors with
field-effect mobility of 570 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{cm^2/V\cdot s}\)</span>, a high drive
current of 216 mA/mm and an on-off ratio of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{2\times 10^4}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong>: Using partially overlapping gates, we
present an electrically defined self-aligned <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SnSe_2}\)</span>/<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{WSe_2}\)</span> heterostructure device.
The device operates as n-type and p-type transistors by applying
appropriate gate biases. The device can also be used as a test platform
to discern the properties of the heterojunction without confounding the
effects of contact resistance. This device can be operated as a tunnel
transistor as well. At room temperature, the device exhibits a
subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/dec.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong>: In this chapter, we present a vertically
integrated double-channel transistor based on ultrathin 2D material to
meet these challenges. The device structure effectively increases the
contact area, thus reducing the contact resistance by about a factor of
two without compromising the device footprint or electrostatic
integrity. The proposed device structure achieves a high drive current
of over 400 mA/mm.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong>: Here, we present infra-red detection
using stable wide-bandgap material heterostructure and electron
transition from one material’s conduction band to the other’s conduction
band. We propose multiple device architectures to understand the
mechanism of the device operation from their bias-dependent photo
response and simple physical models. The device exhibits the
responsivity of  40 mA/W when excited with 1550 nm wavelength IR
radiation. The device operates and exhibits a nearly flat response up to
1800 nm, and a signal above the noise floor could be observed up to 30
kHz.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> concludes the findings of this work and
discusses the future scope.</p>
