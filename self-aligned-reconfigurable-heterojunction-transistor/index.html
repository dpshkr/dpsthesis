<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The main driving force behind the rapid growth in digital technology
has been scaling the transistors to extremely small dimensions. This
reduction of dimensions has resulted in the possibility of packing more
transistors in a given area leading to an increase in the computing
power as well as functionality of electronic devices. Smaller dimensions
also lead to a smaller capacitance of the devices which helps in
increasing the frequency of operation of transistors. However, the
minimum supply voltage possible for transistors has been limited by the
fundamental Boltzmann limit, according to which, when carriers are
injected into the channel from the source through thermionic injection,
the subthreshold slope cannot be less than 60 mV/decade at room
temperature. This inability to scale supply voltage has led to a rapid
increase in the power consumption of transistors.</p>
<p>TFET offers an interesting solution to this problem<span
class="citation" data-cites="ionescu2011tunnel"><sup>1</sup></span> by
exploiting band-to-band tunnelling of carriers rather than thermionic
emission. Promising TFET transistors have been shown previously with
both homojunction (Silicon and Germanium) and heterojunction (III-V
semiconductors)<span class="citation"
data-cites="mohata2011demonstration"><sup>2</sup></span>. However, the
difficulties in obtaining good material interfaces, a sharp doping
profile, and efficient gate control are the main challenges in this
direction. Layered vdW materials can potentially overcome these problems
since the formation of heterojunction with layered materials is not
constrained by the lattice matching of the successive layers<span
class="citation" data-cites="novoselov20162d"><sup>3</sup></span>,
providing an atomically sharp and ultra-clean interface. In addition,
due to the atomically thin nature of the layers, it is possible to tune
the interface effectively using gate voltage.</p>
<p>Band-to-band tunnelling has been explored in several vdW
heterojunctions including /<span class="citation"

heterojunctions. Among these systems, /heterojunction has led to
considerable interest<span class="citation"
data-cites="li2019versatile murali2018gate murali2018self oliva2020wse roy20162d yan2017tunable"><sup>8–13</sup></span>
due to a broken gap (type-III) band alignment in such a system. Broken
gap heterojunction relaxes the requirement for a large external electric
field to achieve a large band-to-band tunnelling current density.</p>
<p>Self-alignment between the channel and the source/drain regions plays
a crucial role in MOSFET technology. This is achieved during the
fabrication process by cleverly sequencing the gate stack fabrication
and the source/drain doping. However, the lack of a conventional doping
process (such as ion implantation) hinders such self-alignment in
devices with layer materials. Instead, a majority of such layer
material-based field-effect devices depend on gate-induced electrostatic
doping in the contact region, often confounding the intrinsic device
operation. It will be thus useful to have a test structure where the
performance of self-aligned devices can be easily tested.</p>
<p>Here we report a triple-gated /  heterojunction device test structure
where we achieve the source-channel self-alignment by using two
partially overlapping top gates. The mode of operation can be
electrostatically tuned from an n-MOSFET to a p-TFET, with the latter
mode providing a sub-60 mV/decade subthreshold slope. The extraction of
the intrinsic electrical characteristics of such heterojunction is often
confounded by the contact series resistance offered by the metal
junction. We get rid of such parasitic effects by the use of this unique
gate-defined self-aligned structure.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-device-structure-and-fabrication">Proposed device

<p>An optical micrograph of the fabricated device is shown in Figure <a

<p>The back gate electrode controls the junction region of the
structure. A top gate stack is then formed right on top of the
/ heterojunction by transferring h-BN and few-layer graphene flakes.
<span> The step-by-step transfer and fabrication flow of the device is
depicted in Figure <a href="#fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01">1.1</a>(b). The
cross-section image of the final step of the process represents the
cross-section of the device.</span> The top gate is electrically shorted
with the back gate for a dual-gate structure. Finally, another gate
stack comprising of h-BN and few-layer graphene is transferred, which
covers the heterojunction and the /Pt contact junction. The  crystal
used in this work is of 2H poly-type as suggested by the Raman spectrum
(). The  flake degenerately n-doped<span class="citation"
data-cites="krishna2017substrate"><sup>15</sup></span> adds negligibly
to the series resistance of the device.</p>
<p>We denote the shorted top and bottom gate electrodes as the
<em>junction gate</em> since they effectively control the junction
region and the  region near the junction of the device. This gate does
not control the contact regions of the device. On the other hand, we
label the third gate on top as the <em>contact gate</em>. This gate has
a partial overlap with the top junction gate (see Figure <a
href="#fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01">1.1</a>(b) and is thus
effectively isolated from controlling the properties of the
heterojunction due to electrostatic screening of the top junction gate.
Hence, this gate only controls the /Pt contact region. This way, the
combination of the two top gates creates the self-aligned structure,
with the two independent gates controlling the contact and junction
region, as delineated by the dashed line in Figure <a
href="#fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_01">1.1</a>(b). In particular,
the dual-gate structured <em>junction gate</em> electrodes efficiently
control the / junction. In contrast, the <em>contact gate</em> on top
only controls the /metal contact region of the device.</p>

temperatures under vacuum (<span

Lakeshore CRX-6.5K probe station using a Keithley 4200 parametric
analyzer. As a control, we first characterize the  channel with Pt
contacts on both sides and use the <em>contact gate</em> as a top gate.
The corresponding transfer characteristics exhibit strong ambipolar
nature (), as is usually observed in typical  channel-based field-effect
devices<span class="citation"
data-cites="movva2015high das2013wse2 li2019versatile"><sup>8,16,17</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Next, we turn our attention to the heterojunction device. First, we
characterize a single gated / device. By applying a suitable combination
of biasing configurations, we tune the mode of operation of the device
from p-TFET to n-MOSFET. Typical temperature-dependent characteristics
of the / heterojunction are shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_02">1.2</a>(a) measured at 7 K
(blue trace) and 295 K (red trace). We observe that in the p-TFET mode
(<span class="math inline">\(V_{G}&lt;0\)</span>), the subthreshold
slope is weakly dependent on temperature. On the other hand, in the
n-MOSFET mode (<span class="math inline">\(V_{G}&gt;0\)</span>), the
carrier injection is governed by the thermal process, and the
subthreshold slope depends strongly on temperature. <span> The same is
reflected in Figure <a href="#fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_02"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Cross-sectional_02">1.2</a>(b) where
sub-threshold swing is plotted as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(1000/T\)</span></span>.</p>
<p> devices usually display ambipolar characteristics, which is
attributed to Fermi level pinning near the middle of the band gap<span
class="citation" data-cites="pang2021mobility"><sup>18</sup></span>.
This usually results in larger contact resistance. It has been shown
previously that a double gate structure can be used to mitigate this
problem, where one of the gates could be used to create an efficient
tunnel barrier near the contacts while the other could be used to
modulate the channel properties<span class="citation"
data-cites="nasr2019mobility"><sup>19</sup></span>. This, however,
usually leads to interference between the two gates; the most noticeable
effect of such a structure is the shifting of the threshold voltage. In
order to overcome this, we design a double gate structure near the
channel, where the electrostatic screening prevents interference between
the contact gate and the junction gate. The region under the contact
gate in the WSe<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> channel can hence
be switched between p-type and n-type modes of operation without any
electrical interference with the junction region. We use the p-type
electrostatic doping for TFET operation and the n-type doping for
regular MOSFET operation.</p>

exhibits stronger band bending. The blue arrow indicates the tunnelling
of the carriers.<span id="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01"

</figure>
<p>Next, we describe the characteristics of the proposed device. In each
mode of operation described below, the <em>contact gate</em> is held at
a fixed bias, while the <em>junction gate</em> is swept through the
required voltage range, both in forward and reverse direction. We
observe negligible hysteresis in the characteristics indicating the
excellent quality of the interfaces of the graphene/h-BN/WSe<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> gate stack.</p>
<p>. The band diagrams and the transfer characteristics of the p-TFET
are shown in Figures <a href="#fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01">1.3</a> and <a
href="#fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_02">1.4</a>(a), respectively.
In this mode of operation, we keep the electrode contacting  as grounded
while applying a negative bias to  contact. The <em>junction gate</em>
is then swept from <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span> V to <span
class="math inline">\(+5\)</span> V, while keeping the <em>contact
gate</em> electrode biased at various negative voltages. Note that, the
<em>junction gate</em> modulates both the  regions in the / interface as
well as adjacent to the interface, as shown by the band diagram in the
top panel of Figure <a href="#fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01">1.3</a>. In particular,
the modulation of the bands in  in the junction region is performed only
by the bottom gate as the gate field from the top gate is screened by
the heavily doped layer<span class="citation"
data-cites="li2014single"><sup>20</sup></span>. However, the  adjacent
to the junction is efficiently modulated by both top and bottom
<em>junction gates</em>. With a more negative <em>junction gate</em>
bias, the tunnelling window for electrons to tunnel from the valence
band of  to the conduction band of  increases, in turn increasing the
drain current (indicated by the blue arrow). On the other hand, at a
more positive <em>junction gate</em> bias, such a band-to-band
tunnelling process is suppressed, as indicated by the red arrow in the
band diagram. Thus, the device in this biasing configuration acts more
like a gated tunnel diode. In the p-type branch of Figure <a
href="#fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_02" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_02">1.4</a>(a), we observe
that the drain current is only weakly dependent on the <em>contact
gate</em> bias compared with the <em>junction gate</em> bias. The
<em>contact gate</em> only modulates the series resistance arising from
the WSe<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>/Pt junction.</p>

label="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_02"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly, the n-type branch exhibits a much stronger current
modulation by the <em>contact gate</em>. In particular, when the
<em>contact gate</em> is biased at a negative voltage of <span
class="math inline">\(-5\)</span> V, we observe that the electron
current is significantly suppressed, and the device displays only a
p-type character with negligible ambipolar behaviour. However, as the
bias of the <em>contact gate</em> is made less negative, the current in
the n-type branch progressively increases, and eventually, the device
exhibits ambipolar characteristics<span class="citation"
data-cites="prakash2017understanding"><sup>21</sup></span>. This effect
is understood by the band diagram in the bottom panel of Figure <a
href="#fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:(a)-Band-diagram-ptype_01">1.3</a>. The <em>contact

<p>Comparing both the modes of operations, we observe that the ambipolar
characteristics of the / heterojunction can be completely suppressed by
appropriately biasing the gates of the triple-gate structure, achieving
a purely n-type (governed by the thermionic process) or p-type operation
(governed by band-to-band tunnelling process). This is achieved by
adjusting the barrier to carrier injection from metal contacts to . The
self-aligned structure of the device ensures that the effect of the

is independent of each other.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a
triple-gated test structure using triple-gated / heterojunction, where a
self-alignment is achieved between the source and channel region by
exploiting the screening between two partially overlapped gates. As a
unique attribute, by tuning the bias at different gate electrodes, the
test structure can be independently operated as p-type TFET as well as
n-type MOSFET with complete suppression of ambipolar characteristics.
<span> With a dual-gated junction control, we obtain excellent
subthreshold swing and current saturation from the device, with the
minimum subthreshold slope being less than 60 mV/decade in the TFET
mode.</span> Such a reconfigurable, multi-functional test structure is
interesting for quick performance evaluation of layered-material-based
self-aligned field-effect devices without the need for source/drain
doping.</p>
