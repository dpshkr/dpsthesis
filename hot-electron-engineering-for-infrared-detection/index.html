<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Infrared (IR) photodetection is of great importance for a wide
variety of technologies. Photodetection in the wavelength range in the C
band (1528–1561 nm) and the L band (1561–1620 nm) is of great interest
for optical communication systems<span class="citation"

inter-band photodetectors, where incident photons excite valence band
electrons to the conduction band, are limited by their bandgap to detect
long wavelength (lower energy) IR radiation. Thus, one must use narrow
bandgap semiconductors to detect infrared photons. Unfortunately, these
low-bandgap materials usually suffer from problems with stability,
complex growth techniques, challenges in integration into standard
fabrication flows, and often possess environment-safety-and-health (ESH)
related concerns<span class="citation"

Unfortunately, there are similar concerns, as stated above, regarding
the narrow bandgap layered materials as well<span class="citation"
data-cites="NithinSinglePhoton chen2017widely"><sup>23,25</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Using widely available, air-stable, wide bandgap materials for IR
detection alleviates most of the above problems. However, the use of
such materials would require a fundamentally different photodetection
mechanism. A well-known mechanism is the intraband photo-excitation of
carriers and subsequent collection of the hot carriers through a
heterojunction<span class="citation"
data-cites="1447578 sze2008semiconductor"><sup>26,27</sup></span>, also

have been widely explored for this purpose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the reasons stated below, for these Schottky
junctions, and more so for those which use 2D layered materials, the
achieved internal quantum efficiency is poor, plaguing the achievable
photodetection efficiency and hence limiting their widespread
applications. This work aims to propose and demonstrate a different
class of intraband IR detector that intrinsically addresses this
issue.</p>
<h2 id="internal-quantum-efficiency-bottleneck">Internal quantum
efficiency bottleneck</h2>
<p>A typical Schottky photodiode utilizes the heterojunction between a
metal and a bulk semiconductor as shown in Figure <a href="#key-issue"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>a. When the
metal absorbs photons with energy above the Schottky barrier height
(SBH), the hot carriers overcome the barrier and get injected into the
semiconductor<span class="citation"
data-cites="1484652 5485040"><sup>39,40</sup></span>. The built-in
electric field in the semiconductor due to band bending pulls the hot
carriers away from the junction (Figure <a href="#key-issue"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>d). The
primary bottleneck in the internal quantum efficiency arises from the
large free electron density in the metal, which causes rapid carrier
relaxation due to ultrafast electron-electron (e-e) scattering. This
results in a small fraction of the generated hot electrons to overcome
the Schottky barrier.</p>
<figure id="key-issue">
<img src="/Figures/04_01.png" />

<p>When an ultra-thin layered semiconductor replaces the bulk
semiconductor (Figure <a href="#key-issue" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>b), and the photocarriers are
extracted laterally, there is an additional mechanism that further
plagues the quantum efficiency of the photodetector, as explained using
the band diagrams in Figure <a href="#key-issue"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>e-f. These
two band diagrams are plotted along the lateral dashed black line and
vertical dashed magenta line in Figure <a href="#key-issue"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>b. Note that
the electric field exponentially drops in the lateral direction within a
transfer length (<span class="math inline">\(L_T\)</span>) from the
metal-semiconductor contact edge<span class="citation"

data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>b-e -
degrading the drift of the photo-generated electrons under the
metal-semiconductor overlap area. On the other hand, being the
energetically favourable process, the photo-induced carriers injected
from metal to the layered material are transferred back to the metal at
a fast timescale (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{sm}\)</span>) (see
Figure <a href="#key-issue" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>f). <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{sm}\)</span> is far shorter than the time
(<span class="math inline">\(\tau_l\)</span>) it takes for the carrier
to traverse the lateral metal-semiconductor overlap area. This results
in poor carrier injection efficiency unless the photocarrier is
generated adjacent to the metal-semiconductor edge<span class="citation"
data-cites="somvanshi2017nature hong2023engineering"><sup>36,41</sup></span>.
This effectively reduces the active area of the photodetector,
eventually resulting in a weak photoresponse.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-device-structure">Proposed device structure</h2>
<p>To circumvent these problems, we propose to use an asymmetric double
heterostructure with a thin barrier layer being sandwiched between the
emitter (carrier injector) and the collector layers (Figure <a
href="#key-issue" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>c). Unlike a typical Schottky barrier
diode, the collector conduction band (CB) edge is chosen to be
energetically lower than the emitter, as shown in Figure <a
href="#key-issue" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="key-issue">1.1</a>g. The proposed structure has several
important features: (a) The light absorption occurs in a doped
semiconductor instead of a metal, and we show later that the interplay
between the availability of free electrons and e-e scattering dictates
an optimum doping that provides the maximum photoresponse. A gate
voltage tunes the doping in the absorbing layer. (b) The band-offsets of
the constituting layers are chosen so that the heterojunction acts as a
valve. Once the hot electrons are transferred from the emitter layer to
the collector layer and relax to the band edge, the back transfer
probability is minimal due to the high energy cost. We note that fast
carrier relaxation is detrimental in the emitter but is desirable in the
collector as it reduces back transfer probability. Thus, choosing a
metal as the collector layer further helps to improve the photoresponse.
(c) The asymmetric band-offsets also help towards the unidirectional
flow of photocurrent, improving the overall efficiency (indicated by the
thickness of arrows in Figure <a href="#schematic-representation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="schematic-representation">1.2</a>). (d) The metal also
acts as a back reflector for the incident photons, and the thickness of
the entire stack is optimized to improve absorption.</p>

<p>We perform a systematic study by fabricating three structures (D1,
D2, and D3), as schematically depicted in Figures <a

corresponding band diagrams. The thickness of the different layered
semiconductors (, , and ) used is <span

devices are encapsulated using h-BN to provide stability from ambient
conditions. Further, the devices are annealed at 150 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{^oC}\)</span> in a vacuum for three hours
to provide good contact between the layers. In D1, we directly place  on
Au film, making a conventional Schottky photodiode. D2 consists of a
stack of // layers. The infrared photons excite electrons in the
conduction band of the  emitter layer, which are collected by the
 collector through the  barrier layer. However, the electrons excited in
the  collector layer find it difficult to cross the barrier due to the
larger barrier to . Finally, in D3, a  barrier layer is sandwiched
between Au collector and  emitter layers. As shown in Figures <a

data-cites="hong2023engineering"><sup>36</sup></span>, likely due to
strong backscattering, as discussed above. D2 and D3 exhibit appreciable
photoresponse; however, <span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> from
D3 is about 1000-fold stronger than that of D2. The enhanced structural
asymmetry and fast relaxation of the injected carriers in the Au
collector layer improve the unidirectional flow of <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> in D3 (Figures <a
href="#schematic-representation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="schematic-representation">1.2</a>e-f).</p>
<p>To understand the difference in asymmetry between D2 and D3, we
perform current-voltage characteristics in the dark condition (Figure <a
href="#schematic-representation_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="schematic-representation_01">1.3</a>b-c). The results
suggest a more diode-like behaviour in D3 compared with D2, which
results in stronger asymmetry. Further, we show the current-voltage
characteristics for D3 at different temperatures (Figure <a
href="#schematic-representation_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="schematic-representation_01">1.3</a>b). Note that when
the electrons are injected from Au to  (negative collector bias), there
is a strong temperature dependence, indicating thermionic emission. We
extract an effective SBH of about 0.16 eV from the temperature
dependence, as shown in Figure <a href="#schematic-representation_01"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="schematic-representation_01">1.3</a>d. On the other
hand, when electrons are injected from  to Au (positive collector bias),
the temperature dependence is negligible, suggesting that the carriers
tunnel through the  barrier layer.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-the-hot-electron-injection">Engineering the hot
electron injection</h2>
<p>When illuminated, the electrons in the conduction band of the emitter
layer are excited to higher energy states. These non-equilibrium high
energy electrons (hot electrons), in turn, relax initially through e-e
scattering in an ultrafast time scale (<span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{ee}\)</span>) and eventually through phonon
scattering at a relatively longer timescale (<span
class="math inline">\(\tau_{p}\)</span>)<span class="citation"
data-cites="mylnikov2024infrared wittenbecher2021unraveling chen2020hot"><sup>44–46</sup></span>.
However, in the van der Waals junctions under consideration, the hot
electrons are also transferred from the emitter to the collector at a
fast timescale (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{ec}\)</span>), with
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{ee} &lt; \tau_{ec} &lt;
\tau_{p}\)</span>. Thus, essentially, the injection efficiency to the
collector is controlled by the e-e scattering rate, which, in turn, can
be controlled by tuning the free electron density in the emitter layer
through a gate voltage (<span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>).</p>

<p>We plot the <span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span> dependence of
<span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> for both D2 and D3 in the
left and right panels of Figure <a href="#sbh-model"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>a,
respectively. For both the devices, <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> initially increases with an
increase in <span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>, reaching a maximum
value, followed by a reduction in <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> with a further increase in <span
class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>. At large <span
class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>, we again observe a weak increasing
trend of <span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>. The initial increase in <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> is expected due to an increase in
the available number of electrons that can be excited to higher energy
states by the incoming infrared radiation (see top panel of Figure <a
href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>b). However, when the electron density
increases significantly (bottom panel of Figure <a href="#sbh-model"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>b), the fast
relaxation due to enhanced e-e scattering tends to quench the hot
electron density, reducing the injection efficiency to the collector,
thus degrading the net <span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We develop a simple physical model to explain such nonmonotonic
behaviour quantitatively, as schematically explained in the bottom panel
of Figure <a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>d. The details of the model are
described in Appendix <a href="#hot-electron-model"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="hot-electron-model">[hot-electron-model]</a>. We solve
the Poisson equation along the vertical dimension to obtain the
electrostatic potential of each layer under dark conditions. We assume
that, under illumination, the nonequilibrium electrons available for
transfer to the collector can be described by Fermi-Dirac statistics
with a higher electron temperature (<span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span>) compared to the lattice temperature
(<span class="math inline">\(T_L\)</span>). <span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> is primarily governed by the e-e
scattering under the condition of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{ee}
&lt; \tau_{ec} &lt; \tau_{p}\)</span>. A higher <span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> broadens the electron distribution
with a longer high energy tail, thus allowing more electrons to cross
the barrier layer (Figure <a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>d). We use <span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> as a fitting parameter. The model
predicted <span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> is shown in blue
traces in Figure <a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>a, and the corresponding fitted <span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> is depicted as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span> in Figure <a href="#sbh-model"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>c.</p>
<p>Consider the case of small <span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>
in Figure <a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>d. The conduction band edges are shown
in black solid lines, and the corresponding electron distributions with
and without photoexcitation are shown in blue and red continuous traces,
respectively. Both are calculated, keeping the total electron
concentration in the conduction band fixed. This is achieved by
calculating a new quasi-Fermi level under illumination. The broader
electron distribution under illumination allows more carriers to cross
the barrier.</p>
<p>At higher <span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>, the free electron
density increases under dark conditions, and the band edges are
energetically shifted downward (shown in black dashed lines). This
increment in the available free electron density results in an enhanced
<span class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> (the rising part in Figure
<a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>a). However, with further increase in
<span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> also decreases due to faster e-e
scattering (Figure <a href="#sbh-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>d), resulting in a narrower electron
distribution (dashed traces in blue and red under dark and illumination
conditions, respectively), eventually reducing <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span>. Figure <a href="#sbh-model"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sbh-model">1.4</a>c indicates
that the fitted <span class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> gradually
reduces with <span class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span> for both D2 and
D3, as expected. With an even further increase in <span
class="math inline">\(V_G\)</span>, the increase in electron
concentration slows down significantly due to screening, which in turn
flattens out <span class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> and results in
either flattening or slight increment in <span
class="math inline">\(I_{ph}\)</span> again. The results suggest an
intricate way to tune the quantum efficiency of the photodetector by
controlling e-e scattering.</p>
<h2 id="infrared-photodetection-performance">Infrared photodetection

<p>We now focus on device D3 for analyzing the IR detection performance.
To understand the steady-state <span

maximum <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of 42 mA/W. Note that,
unlike typical 2D material-based photodetectors, <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> remains a weak function of <span
class="math inline">\(P_{op}\)</span> in the entire range, suggesting a
negligible role of photocarrier recombination and trapping effects.</p>
<p>We extract the noise amplitude (<span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) from the low-frequency temporal
response of D3 (Figure <a href="#performance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="performance">1.5</a>a) by calculating the standard
deviation of the device current under optical illumination. The
corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{I_{ph}}{N}\)</span>) is
plotted in Figure <a href="#performance_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="performance_01">1.6</a>b as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(P_{op}\)</span>, for different <span
class="math inline">\(V_{CE}\)</span>. Interestingly, at low <span
class="math inline">\(P_{op}\)</span>, we obtain higher SNR at <span
class="math inline">\(V_{CE}=2\)</span> V compared with <span
class="math inline">\(V_{CE}=4\)</span> V due to enhanced shot noise at
higher bias. This suggests that an optimal <span
class="math inline">\(V_{CE}\)</span> exists for weak signal detection
to maximize SNR.</p>
<p>The photoresponse of D3 is nearly flat from 1100 nm to 1800 nm
excitation (Figure <a href="#performance_01" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="performance_01">1.6</a>c). A similar broad response is
obtained from D2 as well (see Appendix <a href="#wav-response-of-d2"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="wav-response-of-d2">[wav-response-of-d2]</a>). This
broad response arises because the photon energy at this wavelength range
is significantly higher than the band offset between the emitter and the
barrier layer. The results from another fabrication run of D3 are shown
in Appendix <a href="#char-of-d3-device" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="char-of-d3-device">[char-of-d3-device]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="frequency-response-of-the-detector">Frequency response of the
detector</h2>
<p>Next, we measure the frequency response of D3 using a setup shown in
Figure <a href="#frequency-response" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="frequency-response">1.7</a>a. The detector is connected
to a <span class="math inline">\(V_{BIAS}=-4\)</span> V through an
external load resistor (<span class="math inline">\(R_L\)</span>) of 570
<span class="math inline">\(k\Omega\)</span>, which helps convert the
output current to a voltage signal. The signal from the photodetector is
fed to a JFET-based single-stage amplifier with a load resistance (<span
class="math inline">\(R_D\)</span>) of 100 <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. The JFET is biased with a <span
class="math inline">\(V_{DD}=3\)</span> V. The detector, external
resistors and the JFET are integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB)
(onset in Figure <a href="#frequency-response" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="frequency-response">1.7</a>a). The signal output is then
further bandpass-filtered with an input gain of 20 dB and observed in an
oscilloscope.</p>
<figure id="frequency-response">

<figcaption>(a) Circuit diagram representing the setup to measure the
frequency response. Inset: The 2D photodetector chip integrated into a
PCB with other off-chip electronics. (b) Temporal response of the
detector D3 from 100 Hz to 30 kHz. Signal above the noise floor can be
observed up to 30 kHz. (c) Relative response (<span
class="math inline">\(V_{OUT} / V_{OUT-100\ Hz}\)</span>) in dB of the
device D3 as a function of frequency.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The photodetector is illuminated with a 1550 nm laser at varying
frequencies. The temporal response of the signal for different
frequencies is shown in Figure <a href="#frequency-response"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="frequency-response">1.7</a>b.
The time during which light is illuminated is shown in grey bands in the
top left panel. The signal output progressively diminishes with higher
frequencies. A signal above the noise floor could be observed up to
<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>30 KHz. Figure <a
href="#frequency-response" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="frequency-response">1.7</a>c shows relative
photoresponse (in dB) as a function of the laser intensity modulation
frequency.</p>
<p>The measured frequency response is primarily limited by the
gain-bandwidth product of the external measurement setup and not by the
intrinsic device. The limiting factor likely arises from the relatively
large input capacitance of the JFET. The intrinsic response from the
device itself could be much faster, as all the physical processes
involved in the detection mechanism are fast. In Appendix <a
href="#freq-red-laser" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="freq-red-laser">[freq-red-laser]</a>, we show the
device’s response to 633 nm excitation (which allows bandgap absorption
and hence a stronger signal), demonstrating a detectable response above
the noise floor up to 100 KHz.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, we demonstrate a different class of intra-band
photodetector with intrinsically improved internal quantum efficiency
through elegant hot electron management. The simplicity of the design
makes the device readily integrable with different photo-excitation
schemes, such as with a waveguide. We also demonstrate the heterogeneous
integration of the photodetector chip with post-processing electronics
on a printed circuit board, making it immediately usable at a system
level.</p>
