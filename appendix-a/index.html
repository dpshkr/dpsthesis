<h3 class="unnumbered" id="chemical-synthesis-of-te-nanowires">Chemical
synthesis of Te nanowires</h3>
<p>The Te nanowires are synthesized using <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Na_{2}TeO_{3}}\)</span> as a precursor in
the water medium, where hydrazine hydrate is used as a reducing agent,
Polyvinylpyrrolidone( PVP) as a capping agent, and Ammonia is used to
maintain proper pH. In a typical experiment, 1 g of PVP (average. M.W.=
58,000) is dissolved in 20 ml of DI water and 92 mg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Na_{2}TeO_{3}}\)</span> is dissolved in 15
ml DI water separately. Both solutions are mixed at room temperature.
Into the above solution, 1.5 ml of Hydrazine hydrate and 3.3 ml of 25%
aqueous ammonia solution are added drop-wise with moderate stirring. The
transparent solution is then transferred to a 50 ml capacity teflon
container. Then the hydrothermal reaction is allowed to take place for 4
hours at <span class="math inline">\(180\mathrm{^{\circ}C}\)</span>.
After the reaction vessel cools down to room temperature, the solution
is cleaned twelve times using hot water (<span
class="math inline">\(60^{\mathrm{\circ}}\mathrm{C}\)</span>) at 8000
revolutions per minute and subsequently two times using ethanol.</p>

characterization</h3>
<p>X-ray diffraction measurement has been carried out using Rigaku X-ray
Diffractometer with Cu <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{K\alpha}\)</span> source. Microstructural
characterization has been done using FEI Tecnai T20 S-Twin (200 kV) and
FEI-Titan G2 60-300 microscope operated at 300 kV. To get a
cross-sectional view of the device, the desired pattern has been made
using FEI Helios G4 UX FIB instrument with Ga ion beam source operated
at 30 kV (current <span class="math inline">\(\sim 1.6\)</span> nA)
after depositing the device with Pt (<span class="math inline">\(\sim
3\)</span> micron thick).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="device-fabrication-and-characterization">Device fabrication and
characterization</h3>
<p>The solution synthesized nanowires were first drop cast on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{p^{++}}\)</span> Si substrate with 285 nm
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{SiO_{2}}\)</span> grown on top. The
substrate is the Argon plasma cleaned at a power of 10 W and a pressure
of 10 mbar for 20 s in PlasmaLab system 100 ICP 380 from Oxford
instruments. A thin layer of hBN is then transferred using a dry
transfer method. The substrate is then spin-coated with PMMA C3 and
baked on a hot plate at <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span> C
for 2 minutes. e-Beam lithography is then performed to define the
source, drain, and gate contacts. Patterns are then developed in
MIBK:IPA solution in 1:3 ratio. Substrate is then immediately plasma
cleaned once again using the same parameters. Ni/Au (20 nm/40 nm) is
then deposited on the substrate using DC magnetron sputtering. Finally,
lift-off is performed by dipping the substrate in acetone for 10
minutes, followed by drying.</p>
<p>Room temperature device characterization was done in ambient
conditions using a B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer.
Low-temperature characterization was performed by loading the substrate
in Montana cryostation using a Keithley 4200A semiconductor parameter
analyzer.</p>

<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the operation of the junctionless
transistors, drift-diffusion simulations were performed (as described in
Appendix <a href="#transistor-sim" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="transistor-sim">[transistor-sim]</a>, assuming a charge
sheet model and solving Shockley equations consistently. Band gap of the
material is assumed 0.6 eV, default doping is defined by <span
